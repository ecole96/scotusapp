        <div style="width:50%; margin:auto;">
            <p>SCOTUSApp is an academic research web application commissioned by Dr. Justin Wedeking and Dr. Michael Zilis of the University of Kentucky Political Science Department. The app is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (Award #1849286) and the Department of Political Science at the University of Kentucky.  SCOTUSApp finds, stores, and analyzes online articles pertaining to the United States Supreme Court. It captures news stories, blog posts, and opinion pieces.  It is currently developed by Evan Cole.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>The application consists of three major components:</p><br>
			<h4>The Article Collector</h4>
			<p>Running behind the scenes is a script built to run continuously for the purpose of collecting and storing article data. Articles are gathered from three different sources:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> RSS Feeds set to collect articles with Supreme Court-related terms</li>
				<li><a href="https://newsapi.org/">NewsAPI</a> feeds based on search results for Supreme Court-related terms</li>
				<li>Specific “Topic Sites” – these are web pages from major publications specifically containing Supreme Court articles, such as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/supreme-court-nine">this one</a> from CNN.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These mediums provide article links and often metadata (author, date, etc.) for the articles. Upon gathering this information, articles are then run through our scraping methods to extract the full text and its keywords, any missing metadata, and any images associated with an article.</p> 
			<p>Once an article’s data has been fully collected, it is verified for relevancy to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Lower courts, state Supreme Courts, and foreign Supreme Courts often appear in the feeds, but these are filtered as irrelevant absent some connection to the USSC. This is primarily done by running the article’s text and title through a text classifier powered by machine learning techniques. As of May 2020, our tests indicate an accuracy rate above 95%.</p>
			<p>If deemed relevant, the article is then analyzed for additional data:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sentiment score (and accompanying magnitude) of the article text, powered by the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/">Google Cloud Natural Language API</a>.</li>
				<li>Image entities (and accompanying scores) detected within an article’s images, powered by the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">Google Cloud Vision API</a>.</li>
				<li>Social Media popularity metrics across Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit – likes, retweets, favorites, shares, # of comments, etc. This data is collected at three different intervals – upon entry into the database, 1 day after publication, and 7 days after publication. This is powered by each platform’s own APIs.</li>
				<li>Significant similarity between the texts of any recently-added articles in the database (currently, articles published within 3 days before or after the examined article’s publication are examined). This is represented by a similarity score shared between any two similar articles, calculated through the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine similarity</a> methods.</li>
				<li>Political bias data of an article’s source/publication, powered by information courtesy of <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/">Media Bias Fact Check</a> and <a href="https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings">AllSides.</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Upon analysis, all of the data associated with a new article is stored in our database.</p><br>
			<h4>The Web Application</h3>
			<p>The Web Application is the front-facing aspect of the project, as it allows users to search, view, and download our dataset. Users may download the entire database or the results of a targeted search. Searches may be refined by date, keyword, or source.  Downloads consist of a ZIP file containing a single CSV with article metadata & analysis, and TXT files of each article’s full text named according to the article’s ID. Users must make an account and be approved by the project’s administrators prior to access. As of May 2020, access of the app is limited to the University of Kentucky network, but there are plans to expand to anyone conducting academic research.</p><br>
			<h4>The Database</h3>
			<p>This is where all of the project’s data is stored. Data collection began in Fall 2017 and is ongoing. As of May 2020, over 30,000 articles have been collected. Over time, various improvements and adjustments have been made, and thus this should be taken into consideration by users.</p><hr>

			<h3>How to Use the Application</h3>
			<p>Users must first make an account to access the application. Upon registration, our administrators will be notified to either approve or deny your access. You will be notified of their decision.</p>
			<p>Upon approval, use of the application can begin. Users can search for articles by text (title, keyword, and/or full text), date range, source, and/or article ID. Sources can be filtered through two different methods: either by directly searching for specific sources with the “Sources” search box (multiple sources must be separated by spaces), or checking sources within the “Sources” sidebar and hitting “Apply Filter.” Search results can be downloaded by clicking the “Download Results” button. To restart a search, either hit the “Restart” button or click the main “SCOTUSApp” header. By default, the entire dataset is displayed in the order of descending Article ID. Results can be sorted by clicking the headers in the results table.</p>
			<p>To view more information about an article, click its title in the results table.  This will take you to the article’s individual page, where the data is neatly formatted for perusing. For legal reasons, only the first third of an article’s text is displayed on this page.</p>

			<h3>Understanding Downloads</h3>
            <p>The CSVs provided with downloads contain many columns of data that may not be intuitive. Here is an explanation of each column (as they appear from left-to-right):</p>
